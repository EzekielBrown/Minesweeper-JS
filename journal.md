## Minesweeper

### What

The power of planning a task, breaking it down into several steps, allowed me to better understand its outcome. In making minesweeper, I have been able to use both Top-down and Bottom-Up approaches. Both approaches were very helpful in helping me to understand what I needed to do.

### Why

Through an understanding of both Top-down and Bottom-up approaches, I will be able to solve problems that appear difficult at first glance. The coding part was still a struggle for me, but these methods helped me understand a little better. Using the skills I developed in this assessment, I will be able to view other problems differently. 

### How

Understanding these approaches helped because I felt stuck at a certain point and was unable to move forward. I decided to take a different approach and start at the bottom to help them narrow down the problems to find a solution. I need to remind myself to take a problem and look at it from a different view. I will become faster at finding solutions the more practice I put in.
